# Pygments Whiley

This is a [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) lexer for [Whiley](http://whiley.org/).

## Installation

Install Pygments first. Then run `sudo python setup.py install` or `python setup.py install --user`.

I try to get it merged into Pygments. See [this pull request](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/pull-requests/573/add-a-lexer-for-the-whiley-programming/activity).
